                <p>El álgebra (del árabe: الجبر al-ŷabr ‘reintegración, recomposición’1​ y obtención de datos2​) es la rama de la matemática que estudia la combinación de elementos de estructuras abstractas acorde a ciertas reglas.3​ Originalmente esos elementos podían ser interpretados como números o cantidades, por lo que el álgebra en cierto modo originalmente fue una generalización y extensión de la aritmética.4​5​ En el álgebra moderna existen áreas del álgebra que en modo alguno pueden considerarse extensiones de la aritmética (álgebra abstracta, álgebra homológica, álgebra exterior, etc.).</p>
                <p>El álgebra elemental difiere de la aritmética en el uso de abstracciones, como el uso de letras para representar números que son desconocidos o que pueden tomar muchos valores. Por ejemplo, en
                     <code> x + 2 = 5</code> la letra <code>x</code> es una incógnita, pero aplicando el opuesto se puede revelar su valor <code> x = 3</code>, en<code>E = mc^2</code>
                     las letras M y C son variables , y la letra c es una constante, la velocidad de la luz en el vacío. El álgebra proporciona métodos para escribir fórmulas y resolver ecuaciones que son mucho más claros y fáciles que el antiguo método de escribir todo con palabras.
                </p>
                <p>
                    La palabra álgebra también se utiliza en ciertas formas especializadas. Un tipo especial de objeto matemático en el álgebra abstracta se llama álgebra, y la palabra se utiliza, por ejemplo, en las frases álgebra lineal y topología algebraica.
                </p>
                <p>A diferencia de la aritmética elemental, que trata de los números y las operaciones fundamentales, en álgebra -para lograr la generalización- se introducen además símbolos (usualmente letras) para representar parámetros (variables o coeficientes), o cantidades desconocidas (incógnitas); las expresiones así formadas son llamadas «fórmulas algebraicas», y expresan una regla o un principio general.7​ El álgebra conforma una de las grandes áreas de las matemáticas, junto a la teoría de números, la geometría y el análisis.</p>
                <p>La palabra «álgebra» proviene del vocablo árabe الجبر al-ŷabar (en árabe dialectal por asimilación progresiva se pronunciaba [alŷɛbɾ] de donde derivan los términos de las lenguas europeas), que se traduce como 'restauración' o 'reponimiento, reintegración'. Deriva del tratado escrito alrededor del año 820 d. C. por el matemático y astrónomo persa Muhammad ibn Musa al-Jwarizmi (conocido como Al Juarismi), titulado Al-kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ŷarabi waˀl-muqābala (Compendio de cálculo por reintegración y comparación), el cual proporcionaba operaciones simbólicas para la solución sistemática de ecuaciones lineales y cuadráticas. Muchos de sus métodos derivan del desarrollo de la matemática en el islam medieval, destacando la independencia del álgebra como una disciplina matemática independiente de la geometría y de la aritmética.8​ Puede considerarse al álgebra como el arte de hacer cálculos del mismo modo que en aritmética, pero con objetos matemáticos no-numéricos.9​</p>
                <p>El adjetivo «algebraico» denota usualmente una relación con el álgebra, como por ejemplo en estructura algebraica. Por razones históricas, también puede indicar una relación con las soluciones de ecuaciones polinomiales, números algebraicos, extensión algebraica o expresión algebraica. Conviene distinguir entre:</p>

                <header>Mathematics calculus</header>
                <p>Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape, and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.</p>
                <p>It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while the latter concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit</p>
                <p>Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.[2][3] Later work, including codifying the idea of limits, put these developments on a more solid conceptual footing. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and social science.</p>
                <h1>Etimology</h1>
                <p>In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus is Latin for "small pebble" (the diminutive of calx, meaning "stone"), a meaning which still persists in medicine. Because such pebbles were used for counting out distances,[5] tallying votes, and doing abacus arithmetic, the word came to mean a method of computation. In this sense, it was used in English at least as early as 1672, several years prior to the publications of Leibniz and Newton</p>
                <p>In addition to the differential calculus and integral calculus, the term is also used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories which seek to model a particular concept in terms of mathematics. Examples of this convention include propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus. Furthermore, the term "calculus" has variously been applied in ethics and philosophy, for such systems as Bentham's felicific calculus, and the ethical calculus.</p>
                <h1>Aplications</h1>
                <p>Calculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences,[51]: 1  actuarial science, computer science, statistics, engineering, economics, business, medicine, demography, and in other fields wherever a problem can be mathematically modeled and an optimal solution is desired.[52] It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in studying a problem we know one and are trying to find the other.[53] Calculus can be used in conjunction with other mathematical disciplines. For example, it can be used with linear algebra to find the "best fit" linear approximation for a set of points in a domain. Or, it can be used in probability theory to determine the expectation value of a continuous random variable given a probability density function.[54]: 37  In analytic geometry, the study of graphs of functions, calculus is used to find high points and low points (maxima and minima), slope, concavity and inflection points. Calculus is also used to find approximate solutions to equations; in practice it is the standard way to solve differential equations and do root finding in most applications. Examples are methods such as Newton's method, fixed point iteration, and linear approximation. For instance, spacecraft use a variation of the Euler method to approximate curved courses within zero gravity environments.</p>

                <header>Mathematics artimetic</header>
                <p>Arithmetic (from Ancient Greek ἀριθμός (arithmós) 'number', and τική [τέχνη] (tikḗ [tékhnē]) 'art, craft') is an elementary part of mathematics that consists of the study of the properties of the traditional operations on numbers—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and extraction of roots. In the 19th century, Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano formalized arithmetic with his Peano axioms, which are highly important to the field of mathematical logic today.</p>
                <h1>Addition</h1>
                <p>Addition, denoted by the symbol 
                    +
                    +, is the most basic operation of arithmetic. In its simple form, addition combines two numbers, the addends or terms, into a single number, the sum of the numbers (such as 2 + 3 = 5 or 3 + 5 = 8).</p>
                <p>Adding finitely many numbers can be viewed as repeated simple addition; this procedure is known as summation, a term also used to denote the definition for "adding infinitely many numbers" in an infinite series. Repeated addition of the number 1 is the most basic form of counting; the result of adding 1 is usually called the successor of the original number.</p>
                <p>Addition is commutative and associative, so the order in which finitely many terms are added does not matter.</p>
                <p>The number 0 has the property that, when added to any number, it yields that same number; so, it is the identity element of addition, or the additive identity.

                    For every number x, there is a number denoted –x, called the opposite of x, such that x + (–x) = 0 and (–x) + x = 0. So, the opposite of x is the inverse of x with respect to addition, or the additive inverse of x. For example, the opposite of 7 is −7, since 7 + (−7) = 0.
                    
                    Addition can also be interpreted geometrically, as in the following example. If we have two sticks of lengths 2 and 5, then, if the sticks are aligned one after the other, the length of the combined stick becomes 7, since 2 + 5 = 7.</p>
                <h1>Subtraction</h1>
                <p>Subtraction, denoted by the symbol 
                    −-, is the inverse operation to addition. Subtraction finds the difference between two numbers, the minuend minus the subtrahend: D = M − S. Resorting to the previously established addition, this is to say that the difference is the number that, when added to the subtrahend, results in the minuend: D + S = M</p>
                <p>For positive arguments M and S holds:

                    If the minuend is larger than the subtrahend, the difference D is positive.
                    If the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference D is negative.
                    In any case, if minuend and subtrahend are equal, the difference D = 0.</p>
                <p>Subtraction is neither commutative nor associative. For that reason, the construction of this inverse operation in modern algebra is often discarded in favor of introducing the concept of inverse elements (as sketched under § Addition), where subtraction is regarded as adding the additive inverse of the subtrahend to the minuend, that is, a − b = a + (−b). The immediate price of discarding the binary operation of subtraction is the introduction of the (trivial) unary operation, delivering the additive inverse for any given number, and losing the immediate access to the notion of difference, which is potentially misleading when negative arguments are involved.</p>
                <p>For any representation of numbers, there are methods for calculating results, some of which are particularly advantageous in exploiting procedures, existing for one operation, by small alterations also for others. For example, digital computers can reuse existing adding-circuitry and save additional circuits for implementing a subtraction, by employing the method of two's complement for representing the additive inverses, which is extremely easy to implement in hardware (negation). The trade-off is the halving of the number range for a fixed word length.</p>
                <p>A formerly widespread method to achieve a correct change amount, knowing the due and given amounts, is the counting up method, which does not explicitly generate the value of the difference. Suppose an amount P is given in order to pay the required amount Q, with P greater than Q. Rather than explicitly performing the subtraction P − Q = C and counting out that amount C in change, money is counted out starting with the successor of Q, and continuing in the steps of the currency, until P is reached. Although the amount counted out must equal the result of the subtraction P − Q, the subtraction was never really done and the value of P − Q is not supplied by this method.</p>
                <h1>Multiplication</h1>
                <p>Multiplication, denoted by the symbols 
                    ×\times  or 
                    ⋅\cdot , is the second basic operation of arithmetic. Multiplication also combines two numbers into a single number, the product. The two original numbers are called the multiplier and the multiplicand, mostly both are called factors.</p>
                <p>Multiplication may be viewed as a scaling operation. If the numbers are imagined as lying in a line, multiplication by a number greater than 1, say x, is the same as stretching everything away from 0 uniformly, in such a way that the number 1 itself is stretched to where x was. Similarly, multiplying by a number less than 1 can be imagined as squeezing towards 0, in such a way that 1 goes to the multiplicand.</p>
                <p>Another view on multiplication of integer numbers (extendable to rationals but not very accessible for real numbers) is by considering it as repeated addition. For example. 3 × 4 corresponds to either adding 3 times a 4, or 4 times a 3, giving the same result. There are different opinions on the advantageousness of these paradigmata in math education.</p>
                <p>Multiplication is commutative and associative; further, it is distributive over addition and subtraction. The multiplicative identity is 1, since multiplying any number by 1 yields that same number. The multiplicative inverse for any number except 0 is the reciprocal of this number, because multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself yields the multiplicative identity 1. 0 is the only number without a multiplicative inverse, and the result of multiplying any number and 0 is again 0. One says that 0 is not contained in the multiplicative group of the numbers</p>
                <p>The product of a and b is written as a × b or a·b. It can also written by simple juxtaposition: ab. In computer programming languages and software packages (in which one can only use characters normally found on a keyboard), it is often written with an asterisk: a * b.

                    Algorithms implementing the operation of multiplication for various representations of numbers are by far more costly and laborious than those for addition. Those accessible for manual computation either rely on breaking down the factors to single place values and applying repeated addition, or on employing tables or slide rules, thereby mapping multiplication to addition and vice versa. These methods are outdated and are gradually replaced by mobile devices. Computers use diverse sophisticated and highly optimized algorithms, to implement multiplication and division for the various number formats supported in their system.</p>
                <h1>Division</h1>
                <p>Division, denoted by the symbols 
                    ÷\div  or 
                    /
                    /, is essentially the inverse operation to multiplication. Division finds the quotient of two numbers, the dividend divided by the divisor. Under common rules, dividend divided by zero is undefined. For distinct positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor, the quotient is greater than 1, otherwise it is less than or equal to 1 (a similar rule applies for negative numbers). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend.</p>
                <p>Division is neither commutative nor associative. So as explained in § Subtraction, the construction of the division in modern algebra is discarded in favor of constructing the inverse elements with respect to multiplication, as introduced in § Multiplication. Hence division is the multiplication of the dividend with the reciprocal of the divisor as factors, that is, a ÷ b = a × 
                    1
                    /
                    b</p>
                <p>Within the natural numbers, there is also a different but related notion called Euclidean division, which outputs two numbers after "dividing" a natural N (numerator) by a natural D (denominator): first a natural Q (quotient), and second a natural R (remainder) such that <code>N = D×Q + R and 0 ≤ R < Q</code>

                    In some contexts, including computer programming and advanced arithmetic, division is extended with another output for the remainder. This is often treated as a separate operation, the Modulo operation, denoted by the symbol 
                    mod, though sometimes a second output for one "divmod" operation.[9] In either case, Modular arithmetic has a variety of use cases. Different implementations of division (floored, truncated, Euclidean, etc.) correspond with different implementations of modulus.</p>

                <h3>Formal logical systems</h3>
                <p>Mathematical logic is the study of formal logic within mathematics. Major subareas include model theory, proof theory, set theory, and recursion theory. Research in mathematical logic commonly addresses the mathematical properties of formal systems of logic such as their expressive or deductive power. However, it can also include uses of logic to characterize correct mathematical reasoning or to establish foundations of mathematics.</p>
                <p>Since its inception, mathematical logic has both contributed to and been motivated by the study of foundations of mathematics. This study began in the late 19th century with the development of axiomatic frameworks for geometry, arithmetic, and analysis. In the early 20th century it was shaped by David Hilbert's program to prove the consistency of foundational theories. Results of Kurt Gödel, Gerhard Gentzen, and others provided partial resolution to the program, and clarified the issues involved in proving consistency. Work in set theory showed that almost all ordinary mathematics can be formalized in terms of sets, although there are some theorems that cannot be proven in common axiom systems for set theory. Contemporary work in the foundations of mathematics often focuses on establishing which parts of mathematics can be formalized in particular formal systems (as in reverse mathematics) rather than trying to find theories in which all of mathematics can be developed.</p>
                <p>Mathematical logic emerged in the mid-19th century as a subfield of mathematics, reflecting the confluence of two traditions: formal philosophical logic and mathematics.[3] "Mathematical logic, also called 'logistic', 'symbolic logic', the 'algebra of logic', and, more recently, simply 'formal logic', is the set of logical theories elaborated in the course of the last Nineteenth Century with the aid of an artificial notation and a rigorously deductive method."[4] Before this emergence, logic was studied with rhetoric, with calculationes,[5] through the syllogism, and with philosophy. The first half of the 20th century saw an explosion of fundamental results, accompanied by vigorous debate over the foundations of mathematics.</p>
                <p>At its core, mathematical logic deals with mathematical concepts expressed using formal logical systems. These systems, though they differ in many details, share the common property of considering only expressions in a fixed formal language. The systems of propositional logic and first-order logic are the most widely studied today, because of their applicability to foundations of mathematics and because of their desirable proof-theoretic properties.[c] Stronger classical logics such as second-order logic or infinitary logic are also studied, along with Non-classical logics such as intuitionistic logic.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Logic_gate">
                <header>Logic gate</header>
                <p>A logic gate is an idealized or physical device that performs a Boolean function, a logical operation performed on one or more binary inputs that produces a single binary output</p>
                <p>Depending on the context, the term may refer to an ideal logic gate, one that has for instance zero rise time and unlimited fan-out, or it may refer to a non-ideal physical device[1] (see ideal and real op-amps for comparison).</p>
                <p>In the real world, the primary way of building logic gates uses diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches. Today, most logic gates are made from MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors).[citation needed] They can also be constructed using vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays with relay logic, fluidic logic, pneumatic logic, optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements.</p>
                <p>With amplification, logic gates can be cascaded in the same way that Boolean functions can be composed, allowing the construction of a physical model of all of Boolean logic, and therefore, all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be described with Boolean logic.</p>
                <p>Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million logic gates.</p>
                <p>Compound logic gates AND-OR-Invert (AOI) and OR-AND-Invert (OAI) are often employed in circuit design because their construction using MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual gates.[2]

                    In reversible logic, Toffoli or Fredkin gates are used.</p>

                <header>Scientific model</header>
                <p>The scientific method is an empirical method for acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century (with notable practitioners in previous centuries; see the article history of scientific method for additional detail.) It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; the testability of hypotheses, experimental and the measurement-based statistical testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are principles of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.</p>
                <p>Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, the underlying process is frequently the same from one field to another. The process in the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypothetical explanations), deriving predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.[a][4] A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested</p>
                <p>The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations[A][a][b] agree with or conflict with the expectations deduced from a hypothesis.[6]: Book I, [6.54] pp.372, 408 [b] Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to a remote mountaintop to CERN's Large Hadron Collider. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.[7] Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order</p>
                <h3>Elements of the scientific-model</h3>
                <p>The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations[A][a][b] agree with or conflict with the expectations deduced from a hypothesis.[6]: Book I, [6.54] pp.372, 408 [b] Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to a remote mountaintop to CERN's Large Hadron Collider.

Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.[7] Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order</p>
                <p>The scientific method is an iterative, cyclical process through which information is continually revised.[77][78] It is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements, in varying combinations or contributions</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Characterizations (observations, definitions, and measurements of the subject of inquiry)</li>
                    <li>Hypotheses (theoretical, hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject)</li>
                    <li>Predictions (inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory)</li>
                    <li>Experiments (tests of all of the above)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each element of the scientific method is subject to peer review for possible mistakes. These activities do not describe all that scientists do but apply mostly to experimental sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology). The elements above are often taught in the educational system as "the scientific method".[A]

                    The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity.[79] In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow, but is rather an ongoing cycle, constantly developing more useful, accurate, and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's Principia. On the contrary, if the astronomically massive, the feather-light, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work.</p>
